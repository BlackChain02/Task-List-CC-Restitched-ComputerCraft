Hey little Info to the code 

CC:Tweaked Monitor Size: 4 blocks widh and 3 blocks high
Modoack i use: Create: Astral

At the momentan the code does not function the way I want, but let me tell you what it does.

What the code is actually supposed to do: Is to create 6 Switches(Buttons) you can lable and if all Buttons are clicked the Buttons reset to an Standard lable. 

Atm the code creates 6 Swiches(Buttons) you can Label. If you click one of the Buttons the Button changes the color to lime and reset to an Standart lable. And if all Buttons are clicked the Buttons reset to the Standard lable.
